    <h1>Tears don't fall</h1>
    <h4>Song by Bullet for My Valentine
    </h4>
    <hr>
    <pre>
        With bloodshot eyes, I watch you sleeping
The warmth I feel beside me is slowly fading
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
<br>
There's always something different going wrong!
The path I walk's in the wrong direction!
There's always someone fucking hanging on!
Can anybody help me make things better?!
<br>
Her conscience calls the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls the guilty to come home
The moments died, I hear no screaming
