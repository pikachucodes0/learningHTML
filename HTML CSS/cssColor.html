        For this world to stop hating?
        Can't find a good reason
        Can't find hope to believe in
        Drop dead, a bullet to my head

<p id="p2">
    Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes have seen no conviction

<p id="p3">
    Just lies and more contradiction
So tell me, what would you say?
I'd say it's time to
